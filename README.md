# Non_Adiabatic_Code

This code executes a simple split operator method for a quasidabatic model of OH + H conical intersection with the inclusion of spin orbital coupling.

All parameters are accounted for, to run, simply execute the code. This is very basic and I will update the code later on in the year.
